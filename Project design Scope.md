Project design Scope

SRMC â€“ Switched Reluctance Motor Controller

Create a product that is understandable for everyone to use like the Arduino.

Create an Arduino SRMC shield (a three phase asymmetric half bridge)

Create a GitHub account to document hardware, software and features

How to get Xometry to manufacture electrical steel

Record the process of you creating the SRMC

Start with the Arduino Shield Power Stage with possible Gate Driver ICs and future FPGA expansion HAT/Shield on Shield min expansion board

FPGAs managing current sensing and gate timing

Expansion Set with FPGA in the future

Leverage existing knowledge with the EECS_476.6 Coursework PMSM TMS320 based trapezoidal, sinusoidal and field oriented control project contents for design reference.

Create a purpose built hardware implementation with STM32 based on their devkit board

Subtract the transformer and have a dedicated 15V/30V - 12-36V input and required power supply.

Document the entire process and create an intro to SRM controls course from scratch beginning to end

Have it be three different courses: intro to SRM controls with Arduino which includes soft/hard chop control both SECs (Sensor Excited Commutation) and angle control.

SRM angle control both the programming and characterization process.

SRM Controls III with Flux Virtualization Control (Flux Control / Saturation Control / Anti-Saturation Control / Anti-Sat Control / Saturation Prevention Control / Anti-Current Saturation Control / Anti-Saturation Current Control)

Then create the full version with STM32 hardware and bespoke PCB

All along get input from the experts on board layout (consult the build a project in 2 hours competition youtubers), on software architecture, get some people excited about the project on both the controls and SRM design side of things all the while consulting the experts.

Document the process of creating a SR motor for testing a 1/8 hp little test machine 6/4 machine get Xometry to cut the steel and glue it? Or bolt it together?

VESC Style GUI based control configuration and test platform

Hardware Open Source Kicad or Altium Files gerber files for creating and printing PCBs from a quick PCB shop

Documentation on the theory and practice behind SR Motor Control

Expandable SRM Controller platform to include brake chopper and paralleling ability to share make larger network of controllers for more power
